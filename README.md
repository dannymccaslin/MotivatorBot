# MotivatorBot
==============

MotivatorBot is a Twitter bot hosted at @MotivatorBot1. MotivatorBot tweets out a random motivational quote during a random timeframe; right now its within a randomized three-hour window.
There is a 1 in 4 chance of the bot tweeting out to a random follower.

## Purpose
----------

There are multiple goals for this project. One is to learn about Python and tweepy. Another is to spread a little bit of positivity. The third is to examine synchronicity. I've always been interested in the idea of synchronicity and I thought that, with this thing tweeting to random followers, there is a chance that someone will receive a quote that hits them in the right way at the right time. Those are the places that I'm interested in. So if you follow, and you receive a tweet that hits you particularly hard, let me know.
